PythonJoust
===========

A version of Joust, the old arcade game. I'm just making this for fun, and to brush up my Pygame skills.

Requirements:

Python 3 (get the latest one from python.org)

Pygame (get the latest one from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame )

Run joust.py and enjoy!
Feel free to fork and let me know how it goes.
